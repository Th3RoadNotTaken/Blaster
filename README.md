## About the project
I'm creating a competitive shooter which will consist of game modes such as team deathmatch and capture the flag.
* This game will consist of mechanics such as jumping, strafing, and leaning while shooting.
* There will be various types of weapons such as Assault Rifles, SMGs, Shotguns, Rocket Launchers, etc.
* There will also be several pickups throughout the map such as Ammo, Health, Speed & Jump Buffs, and Shield Bars.

## Technical Aspects
* UE5's enhanced input system to implement all player inputs.
* Aim Offsets for updating the character's upper body rotation while aiming at different angles.
* FABRIK - Forward and Backward Inverse Kinematics for adjusting the character's left hand correctly on any gun they hold.
* Implemented several multiplayer networking aspects such as Actor Replication, Rep Notifies, Remote Procedure Calls(RPCs), Conditional Replication, etc.
* Game mode class for defining the rules of the game such as when the player gets eliminated and how to respawn the player.
* Player state class for defining the rules to update player scores and defeats.
* Parameterized material instances for dissolving the character mesh once eliminated.

I'm currently working on implementing Weapon Ammo and Player's Carried Ammo.
